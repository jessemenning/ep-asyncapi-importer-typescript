Known Limitations
=================

Duplicate Assets
----------------

Assets are imported into the either the global domain specified at the command line or the domain specified by the extension `$.x-ep-application-domain-name`.

If you have the same Asset definied across multiple Apis that are imported into different domains, then these Assets are created in each domain.

Orphaned Assets
---------------

Assets are keyed on the name (see :ref:`importer-content-overview-asset-mapping`).

If you change assets names (channels, messages, schemas), the old assets remain in Event Portal and if no Event Api is using them they become orphaned.

There is currently no mechanism to detect and remove such orphaned assets.




Asset Inconsistency Error
-------------------------

The importer can only test for inconsistencies of Asset definitions within a single run, i.e. across the Apis imported in a run,
before importing into the final target application domain.

It does not check exisiting assets in the target application domain (generated by a previous run or manually),
which may lead to WARNNGS when importing.

To resolve any inconsistencies, fix the underlying issue in the Api file(s) and import the same run again.
