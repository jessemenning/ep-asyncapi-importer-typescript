Asset Inconsistency Error
-------------------------

The importer can only check for inconsistencies within a single run, i.e. across the Apis imported in a run.

It does not check exisiting assets (generated by a previous run or manually), which may lead to inconsistencies.

If this happens, the importer is not able to 'rollback'.
To resolve the inconsistencies, fix the underlying issue in the Api file(s) and import the same run again.
